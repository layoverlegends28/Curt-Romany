Layover Legends — Swipe Card App (PWA) Prototype
================================================

What this is:
- A fully working, installable "web app" that swipes through your Reflection & Travel deck.
- Luxury Black·Gold & Navy·Gold themes.
- Swipe left/right on touch; arrow keys on desktop.
- Shuffle, restart, and share the current card.
- Offline capable via service worker. Guests can "Add to Home Screen".

How to deploy (Netlify):
1) Upload the entire folder to Netlify (drag & drop).
2) Ensure "index.html" is the site entry.
3) After publish, open the site on a phone, use the browser menu to "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen".

Customize the deck:
- Edit data.json (title/text per card). You can add 'cards': [ {title, text}, ... ].
- The app reads this JSON at load time.

Printing:
- For print materials, use the print-ready PDFs from your Reflection & Travel Launch Pack.
